ronz,5,Superb phone and exceptional camera.,"Delivery was excellent, it was very well packaged, and the phone is perfect, a great upgrade for me, the camera is exceptional, more than I thought it would be, the phone is very fast too, I'm over the moon with it.",6 April 2024
W. Davies,5,A step up from my S20,"My S20 was/is fine, apart from battery life not being great. This being new is far, far better, but it's also a lot quicker too, worth the upgrade.",4 May 2024
Manole Danut,4,"Good phone, mediocre battery.","The overall product is good. When opening the box you will only get the phone and a 1 meter long usb C (at both ends cable) so you will need to buy a separate 25W charger which costs around 15 GBP. The phone quality, design, camera, sound are great. The only minus this phone has is clearly the battery. If you are the kind of person that will use their phone quite often during the day and you won't be home for let's say 10h+, then the battery won't last you without charging it mid-day. The charging is decently fast, takes 1h to charge it from 20% to 85% with the Samsung 25W charger. Other than the battery, the phone has been a huge upgrade in all areas from my Oneplus 5T (2018). Really happy with the camera, sound and overall smoothness in the menu & apps.",25 July 2022
Tilly,5,My new phone,"I am really happy with my upgrade.

Abel Abraham,1,About Phone,"Don't buy this mobile because there is no imei number on this phone's back if it is orginal there will be imei number written on its back so in this case the samsung service centre could'nt repair my phone , they are telling its fake ..!!",5 April 2024

emmafrost13,5,So far so good :),"Given I'm using the phone right now to post this review, I guess it's just as expected :)

Harry,3,Samsung Galaxy S22 - A Mixed Bag of Features,"The Samsung Galaxy S22 5G Mobile Phone in Phantom Black has left me with a mixed set of impressions, combining some notable strengths with a few disappointments. Here's a detailed breakdown of my experience with this smartphone, resulting in a 3/5 rating:

Pros:

Impressive Build Quality: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
The Galaxy S22 boasts the impeccable build quality that Samsung is known for. The sleek design, coupled with the Phantom Black finish, exudes a premium look and feel. The device feels robust and well-crafted in hand.

Vivid Display: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
The display quality is stellar, as expected from Samsung's flagship devices. The vibrant colors, sharp resolution, and ample brightness levels make for an immersive viewing experience, whether I'm browsing, watching videos, or playing games.

Powerful Performance: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
The device's performance is commendable, thanks to its robust hardware configuration. Apps launch quickly, multitasking is smooth, and the overall responsiveness is impressive. The inclusion of 5G connectivity adds a future-proof element to the device.

Cons:

Limited Battery Life: ⭐⭐ (2/5)
The battery life of the Galaxy S22 falls short of expectations. The relatively small battery struggles to keep up with the demands of the high-resolution display and powerful processor. It often requires midday recharges, impacting its suitability for users with heavy usage patterns.

Camera Performance: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
While the camera setup on the Galaxy S22 is versatile and capable, the performance in certain conditions leaves something to be desired. In low-light scenarios, the camera tends to struggle, resulting in grainy and less detailed images. The camera software updates could potentially improve this aspect.

Incremental Upgrades: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
The Galaxy S22, while a capable device, doesn't bring groundbreaking upgrades over its predecessor. The improvements are incremental, and for users already owning a recent Samsung flagship, the allure of upgrading may be diminished.

Overall Verdict:

The Samsung Galaxy S22 5G Mobile Phone earns a 3/5 rating due to its impressive build quality, vivid display, and powerful performance. However, the limitations in battery life, camera performance in specific conditions, and the lack of groundbreaking features make it a device with both strengths and room for improvement. Depending on individual priorities and preferences, users may find the Galaxy S22 to be a solid choice or may opt for alternatives offering more significant upgrades.",14 December 2023
webwolf,3,Boot looped several times,"This thing was brand new out of the box with all the protective stickers etc... When I turned it on, it got stuck on the boot screen then boot looped 3 or 4 times before crashing to the recovery screen.

I factory reset and it sat on the boot screen for a good 10 minutes before finally turning on...

Not sure if it's faulty but it's a temporary device while my faulty device goes in for repair so hopefully it'll at least last a few weeks...",14 May 2024
DaveyG,4,Usual Samsung Galaxy Quality,"Exactly what I expected from my 4th Samsung Galaxy phone. The only negative is that the battery doesn't last as long as my previous S8. This is perhaps due to the amazing, quality and high definition screen and camera. Very fast and I would definitely recommend.",6 March 2024
Dave,3,Beware - this phone is intended for the American market,"On opening the box it became clear this was an American import - it included a SIM card for America! I did succeed in connecting it to my old Samsung and transferring everything across. However I then had to spend several hours changing all the settings (language, keyboard, etc) from USA to UK. Once up and running the phone then proceeded to download and install Android updates - but as this was a fairly old model this again took hours - Android produce a security update every month and it seems they have to be applied in chronological order, rather than just applying the most recent.",1 February 2024
cherie annette glover,5,Great phone & camera/sound!,"Nice phone, great camera, sound, size, really happy with it!",12 April 2024
bob,2,Battery life terrible,"Generally the phone was in good working order but the battery life is awful and sometimes the percentage jumps about when charging which makes me think it was not properly checked or tested. I contacted the seller, I am out of the country and offered to find a 3rd party to fix it, but no help was possible. Frustrating.",29 May 2024
Miss Lyndsay Kelly,4,Decent,"Decent phone, great camera. Much like an A70 but much smaller...not necessarily a bad thing. Sadly doesn't come with an adapter, just a cable which I wish I'd have realised before considering a new super fast Samsung original charger costs around £44. This should definitely be included but Samsung obviously making more money this way. Aside from that, great phone",10 October 2023

Mr G.,2,Great for one year. Then not.,"One of the cameras was blurry after one year and the charge port only works part of the time now.
It really was great for that first year though, but not worth paying this much for something that doesn't last.",19 May 2024

PAUL COLLIS,5,New phone,"I was cautious at buying a new phone on amazon especially as the price was so much lower than Argos and Curry's etc however I was very pleased both with delivery, packaging and value. Perfect. Makes me question shop prices now!",14 January 2024
Randeer Mattu,4,S22 SAMSUNG GALAXY,This phone has much more quality certain things like camera let's it down the old S range beats this hands down but everything else is definitely got quality like deleting someone from a photo snap that's kool this phone has it bad points just like every phone but definitely would rate it a 7/10 price is too high for not much more of a phone.,27 April 2023

Nick Brooks,5,Great buy!,"Excellent value: cost about £300 less than John L were charging for the same phone! Received on the day of purchase.
The phone's great. Far more adverts than my previous android phone, but I guess that's not down to the phone itself. Also some difficulty getting android auto to connect at first but resolved by buying a Samsung USB A to C cable.",10 November 2023

Mahedi Hasan,2,it becomes hot,"The product performance was amazing, nothing to say against it. The camera was outstanding, the quality of the screen too. However I did not have much time to use it in deep. That because I returned, although great performance. And this especially because it started to get hot everytime I used it, it was awful, my hand could not handle it. For this reason I disagree to buy another one, because it became that hot that I couldnt use it. Really a terrible experience.",18 January 2024
Alex K,4,Good phone,"Good - not great. This is coming from someone who previously had the S9. As a long time Galaxy user the S9 is arguably the best phone in the Galaxy run. It was hard to part from it, when all that was wrong was its cracked screen. But I did, and opted for the S22 this year. From inspection of other friends S21 it's not that different. However its perhaps cosmetically smoother and rounder in shape. In terms of what you can do with it - i've yet to explore or notice anything substantially appealing. I bought this because I love taking photos and so this or the S20 were on my list. This won out because its newer and not much in the way of price.",6 April 2022
Malairt,4,Really good phone,"Battery life isn't great: at the end of the day I have about 30 - 40% left and I don't do gaming. It's browsing and streaming radio, plus the odd phone call.

But it's a great size - fits my hand well - and the performance in streaming and opening web pages is way better than I had before: no stuttering or long pauses.",13 January 2023

Gillian Smith,5,Good buy,Hugely better than my old Samsung J3. Excellent camera. Battery life is absolutely fine for my purposes as I don't play games etc. Very good sound quality.

Dave Wood,5,Excellent phone,"Upgraded from my old S10 to this S22, I'm loving this, camera is excellent, it's perfect for me, battery life is great & it's still a familiar interface. It's also a good size & a perfect fit in my hand.",13 September 2023
Charlie,5,"Nice Size, Good Calue","Big advance over previous phone. I use medical apps on it and it is so much better than before. Samsung keyboard a a bit detailed for my fingers, but can always change to a different one.
Battery doesn't last a full day when used a lot, so I bought a power pack which solves the issue.",14 June 2023
rosco,5,Good,Good phone just be careful that you get the right case for it has I paid 20 pounds for one that amazon recommend and it was the water proof and shock proof case but the finger print ID is not good,13 July 2023
lovelythings,5,BRILLIANT,"Great phone as my Samsung 20 gave up after constant use for nearly 3 years, bought outright as got a Sim Only deal with EE for £8 a month unlimited everything.......would never use any other phone other than Samsung, tried others in the past but Samsung is the best one for me personally.",19 May 2023

Sam's Mum,2,European Model,BE AWARE THIS IS A EUROPEAN MODEL. This means that apps like Samsung Pay will not work in the UK as the country cannot be changed once registered. Bit rubbish as I use it all of the time. I cannot see anywhere in the description that mentions this. Otherwise the phone seems good so far. Will try to get a replacement.,6 October 2023

Tahmid,5,The phone is brilliant. I was looking for an upgrade.,"The phone is smooth compared to my S9, it's fast, has a lot of new features. If you're looking for a new phone but don't want to pay the price of iPhone, then go with this one. If not, then purchase one of the higher models. Like S22+ or S22 Ultra.

Overall love the phone, quick, light, fits in my hands. Can't complain.",1 October 2022

Ayaan Shaikh,5,Excellent purchase - an all rounded success.,"Was expecting a poor battery life and a mediocre display from this device, but had been instantly proven wrong upon arrival. The phone arrived brand new and sealed, with no delays. As for the actual device, everything has just been ""excellent"". The phone sometimes takes better pictures than my iPhone 15, the battery lasts for days on end, and the UI is of the best that I have seen on a smartphone.

As a dedicated tech reviewer, I highly recommend this phone to anyone who is looking for a capable device below the price of £500/$500.",13 May 2024

Chloe Jagger,1,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER,"I bought this phone roughly a month ago, everything was working fine until I randomly recieved a notification saying my phone will be locked in 73 hours due to an incomplete trade in. Since I bought the phone from Amazon, that should obviously not happen. So essentially what the seller has done is he bought phones from Samsung saying he will submit his own phone to get them for a cheaper price and then procceded to sell them off for FULL PRICE! Neither Amazon or Samsung could do anything so I had to return the phone which luckily I will be getting my money back for. The phone works fine but it is safer to just buy it from Samsung directly.",7 June 2022

Mr. C. J. Lewis,1,Pretty disappointed,"The battery on this phone is absolutely rubbish if I am being brutally honest. Not only that the bloat ware from Samsung makes the phone not very intuitive. If you like Samsung then you're probably used to that.
I upgraded from a Google pixel 4a, not the quickest or best phone, but I am considering swapping back to it. It had a better battery, was simpler to use and smoother in operation.
Battery life example from today. Went to bed about 11 with 100% charge. Sleep mode on over night and all things closed. Wake up 0650 and battery is 83%. What has it been doing over night when all apps closed, all connections turned off etc?
It is now 76% at 0710 and all I have done is browse Amazon for about 10 minutes and write this review.
My daughter is still using my Samsung J6+ from 2018 and that is better than this phone. At least she doesn't have to look for a charger by 11 am each day.
Buyer beware..........",8 December 2023
